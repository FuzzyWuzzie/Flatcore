# Flatcore
A plugin for implementing all the various things necessary for flatcore

## Functionality
* Whenever a player spawns (either for first time, or after a death), they're placed in a random location (configurable)
* Beds only skip night - they don't have anything to do with respawning
* When a player dies, their entire inventory is destroyed (configurable)
* When a player dies, they are death-banned for 12h (configurable)
* When a player dies, custom messages are sent to the player, other players, and the console informing them about how their died
* When a player tries to join when death-banned, they will be rejected and told how long until they can rejoin
* For 30s after respawn (configurable), players have immortality - they cannot be damaged in any way, and mobs will not target them
* When a mob dies, if it wasn't killed by a player, it doesn't drop any loot
* Players, mods, and admins all have different death-ban times (admins cannot be death-banned)
* Players can read the weekly challenges in-game (both previous and current challenges)
* Mods can set the weekly challenges in-game (both previous and current challenges)
* The entire state of the plugin saves itself across /reloads, so /reloads are invisible to users
* Console can use all the commands
* Plugin configuration can be reloaded with a command
* Challenge presentation template is configurable

## Commands
* `/flathelp [page]` - lists all the "flatcore plugin" commands you have access to, and what they do
* `/challenge [id]` - tells you what the current weekly challenge is if you omit the [id], or tells you the weekly challenge for your specified id
* `/deathban <player> <time>` - set's a player's deathban. If they're not currently death-banned, it will death-ban them for a given time. Time in XwXdXhXmXs format
* `/startchallenge [id]` - starts you writing a weekly challenge ([id] is optional, if excluded a new challenge will be inserted). All chat you send to the server after sending this command will be appended to the challenge
* `/appendchallenge <text>` - explicitely adds text to the currently edited challenge (implemented for console use)
* `/endchallenge` - stops writing a weekly challenge. All the chat text you've been accumulating in the challenge thing gets collected, and inserted as either an edited or new weekly challenge based on what ID you were editing
* `/flatreload` - reloads the flatcore config file

## Permissions
